  <p> I have always loved photography; even as a teenager, I would cut high school and sneak off to NYC to look at photos at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>


<p>
As the years go on, I am drawn to what is around me in the natural world. A photograph only represents a moment in time. That time will never occur ever again. I never try to force a photo.</p>


<p>
Over time I realize that nature and the world around you will only reveal what it chooses to. You cannot force a photograph. You may think you are the creator, but in reality, you are only the witness to that moment in time.</p>
<p>
I have studied/done workshops with the following noted individuals:</p>
<p>Fred Picker: Zone Vi Workshops 1978</p>
<p>Arkady Lvov:  Platinum Workshop at The New School 1998</p>
<p>Mark Osterman:  Photo Historian at the George Eastman House; learning Collodion Printing Out Paper</p>
<p>Richard Ritter & Bruce Barlow: doing Large Format Workshops</p>
<p>Paula Chamlee: Vision Workshop 2022</p>
